# Object Tuning Replacement Script for The Sims 4

A lightweight script mod that fixes tuning inconsistencies in EA objects — especially those that should be portable or draggable but aren't.

### ✅ Features
- Replaces incorrect object tunings at runtime
- Adds missing Live Drag components
- Fully automatic and pack-aware
- No tuning overrides, no conflicts, no patch issues
- Fallback support if DLC is missing

### 📝 Logging
Creates a log file in your Sims 4 folder.  
Uses Smart Core logger if available.  
No setup required — just install and play.
